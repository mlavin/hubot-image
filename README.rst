Hubot Image
===========

This is a Dockerfile to build and run your own `Hubot <https://hubot.github.com/>`_.
The image is based on the `alpine-node <https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node>`_ images
to keep the base to a minimum. At the same time the allowed plugins are bundled into
the image so that it only needs to be run with no additional install, cutting
down on the start-up time.
